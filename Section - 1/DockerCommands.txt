Section 1
---------

docker build .                                            - creates docker image and provides id of the image
docker run -p <localhost-port>:<container-port> <imageId> - creates a new container and runs the container based on image
docker ps                                                 - lists all running containers
docker ps -a                                              - lists all running/exited containers
docker stop <containerName>                               - stop the container
--help                                                    - can be added to any docker command to list the available options

Section 2
---------

docker run node                   - to directly run an image with name from dockerhub - this downloads the image automatically and runs 
                                    as a container - this exits after starting since the container runs in isolation and there is no 
                                    interactive session exposed to the user
docker run -it node               - now this starts the another container and provides a node shell where we can execute js code                  
docker pull node                  - to download a file from the remote repository
docker start <containerName>      - to restart a stopped container
