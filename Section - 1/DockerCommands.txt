Section 1
---------

docker build .                                            - creates docker image and provides id of the image
docker run -p <localhost-port>:<container-port> <imageId> - creates a new container and runs the container based on image
docker ps                                                 - lists all running containers
docker ps -a                                              - lists all running/exited containers
docker stop <containerName>                               - stop the container
--help                                                    - can be added to any docker command to list the available options

Section 2
---------

docker run node                                              - to directly run an image with name from dockerhub - this downloads the image automatically and runs 
                                                               as a container - this exits after starting since the container runs in isolation and there is no 
                                                               interactive session exposed to the user
docker run -it node                                          - now this starts the another container and provides a node shell where we can execute js code                  
docker pull node                                             - to download a file from the remote repository
docker start <containerName>                                 - to restart a stopped container
docker start -a <containerName>                              - to restart a stopped container in attahced mode
docker run -p <localhost-port>:<container-port> -d <imageId> - creates a new container and runs the container based on image in detached mode
docker attach <containerName>                                - to attach with a detached container
docker logs <containerName>                                  - to see all the past logs of the container
docker logs -f <containerName>                               - to see all the past/active logs of the container

With docker run we are only attached to the output of the container, we cant input (like Scanner) anything unless we are in interactive 
mode with the terminal provided by the container for that we run images with -i (interactive) -t (pseudo TTY)

docker run -it <containerName>                               - now this starts the another container and provides a shell where we can input
docker rm <containerName> <containerName> ...                - to remove a stopped container
docker images                                                - lists the images
docker rmi <imageId>                                         - to delete image not used by container
docker image prune                                           - to remove all unused images at once
docker container prune                                       - to remove all stopped containers at once
docker run -p <host-port>:<container-port> --rm <imageId>    - to remove the container automatically when it exits
docker image inspect <imageId>                               - to inspect the image
docker cp <source-path> <container-name:dest-path>           - to copy files from and to a running container
docker run -p <port>:<port> --name <cont-name> <imageId>     - to name a container while running
docker build -t <name>:<tag> .                               - to build an image with tag
docker push <repositoryName>:<tag>                           - to push an image to the docker hub after creating the repository (keep the image tag and repository name the same for pushing the image)
docker tag <oldImageTag> <newImageTag>                       - to retag the name of a created image
docker login                                                 - to login to docker hub locally before pushing the images
