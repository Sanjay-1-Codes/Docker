Images 
------

* The images are similar to Class in java 
* Its a template that contains the written code and all its dependencies bundled together for running 
  the code
* We can run prebuilt images from a public repo called - dockerhub
* Image is read only
* Images are layer based i.e when we rebuild an image, docker sees if there's any change associated 
  to each and every command (like FROM/WORKDIR) in an orderly way and executes all command from the 
  point where there is a change, if there are no changes it uses everything from the cache to rebuild 
  the image
* This is called Layer based architecture, each and every command in DockerFile represents a layer  


Container
---------

* The containers are similar to Objects in java
* With single image we can build multiple instances of the containers up and running
* Multiple containers doesnt mean that our image is copied multiple times and run 
* When multiple containers are run based on a same image, then all of them uses the same image file 
  as refrence(not copied) and allocates space and memory separately thus making the process more efficient
* Container simply adds an additional layer on top of the image, that's the CMD layer used to run the applciation  

docker run vs docker start 
--------------------------

* With docker run, once we execute the command the terminal freezes and we are not allowed to enter any more commands
  until the running instance of the container is stopped
* With docker start, once we execute the command the terminal is not freezed it allows us to run other commands, but also 
  the container is restarted and running
* What's the difference bw these two?
